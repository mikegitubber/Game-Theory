# Game-Theory
It is a MERN Stack project where there are 2 types of Users One is Admin and a customer.



Customer:
 A customer initially can sign up for the website where his password is encrypted using bcrypty and for user authantication I have used JWT Tokens. And Once when the user has signed Up he then is redirected to Login Page where he needs to Login with the emailId and PassWord he/she has provided.
        Now once the user is successfully LoggedIn he/she can see the available places where the services are present.And when the user chooses a city of their choice it shows the available sports at the particular place . Now when the user picks his sport it displays the available courts with occupied courts with usernames displayed marked red and available slots and courts are marked green. 
    And the user can see his bookings in the dashboard.
Admin:
Admin has all the above mentioned features with a extra feature of manipulating the bookings either removal or adding.

Software Requirements:

A good laptop/PC with nodeJS installed in it is good enough to run this project.
